        <h1>My Initial Thoughts</h1>
        <p>
          Initially, I was looking for classes to pick as a perspectives course for my Spring 2025 semester,
          as suggested by my advisor Dr. Hardy. I can't remember all the perspectives courses on the
          Course Registration portal, but I settled for the Human Diversity course as I thought it would look
          good on my resume, and that I also think there were aspects of my beliefs that could be refined.

        <h1>Revelation</h1>
        <p>
          Autism plays a major part of my life, that makes up who I am.
          I was diagnosed when I was around 4-5 years old, on the lower-end of the spectrum according to my mother.
          As a kid, I found it hard to make friends, and had a few good friends who I still keep in contact with.
        </p>
        <p>
          I never knew I had autism until my mother finally told me when I was 13-14 years old.
          I knew I was different from other people back then, but the news helped me to see myself in
          a different light a few years after the reveal. I never fully appreciated my autism until I
          met one of my best friends at the end of middle school who I didn't know was autistic, but turned my life around
          after meeting them.
        </p>
        <p>
          It wasn't until I was in ninth grade that the term "sped(s)" was being spread around.
          It is a derogatory term, used by the students back then to call someone slow, stupid, and moreso
          how intellectually low their perception of the receiver is. To hear that coming from someone hurts.
          But the thing is, they don't realize the potential that is dormant within a disabled person.

        <h1>Ableism</h1>
        <p>
          To me, ableism is the type of discrimination, oppression, or bias towards people
          for their disabilities and/or impairments that affect their everyday life.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is a bias that goes beyond centuries of disabled people being compared to the likes of the non-disabled,
          by the privileged dominant groups in society that lack the context and failed empathy towards the people who
          were born in a certain way, or their difficulties to keep up with the non-disabled.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've met and worked with people who have disabilities, mothers and fathers too.
          They're people who aren't vocal about their struggles, but they're doing their best to survive inside.

        <h1>Treating those with Physical Disabilities and Mental Disabilities with Respect</h1>
        <p>
          When I talk about people with physical disabilities, I talk about those everyday people in our lives
          who are handicapped...
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>...who find difficulty in moving...</li>
          <li>...find difficulty in using their entire hand...</li>
          <li>...humans that can't see straight or at all...</li>
          <li>...and those who are handicapped in using limbs or body parts for everyday life.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For the people with mental disabilities, they are also people living their everyday lives with inner burdens, disabilities including,
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Autism Spectrum Disorder - characterized by repetitive and inflexible patterns of behavior and interests.</li>
          <li>Bipolar disorder - characterized by periods of depression and elevated moods, that can last several days, weeks, months, etc.</li>
          <li>Anxiety disorders - characterized by uncontrollable feelings of anxiety and fear that can impair someone's social, occupational, and personal life.</li>
          <li>Intellectual disorder - characterized by impairments in intellectual and adaptive functioning.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I don't know why non-disabled people treat those with mental disabilities differently than those with physical difficulties.
          Society has a way of treating those with physical disabilities with respect, but for those who carry different disabilities,
          they are seen as different. They are ostracized from job opportunities, relationship opportunities, and more.

        <h1>The significance of Ableism to me</h1>
        <p>
          As a person on the spectrum, I don't expect everyone to be kind to me, or fully comprehend the social difficulties that I go through.
          After all, we are an imperfect human species, capable of kindness, empathy, kinship, and much more.
          Yet, I find that we all still have growing to do as a species,
          seeing as the less fortunate are doing everything in their power to live comfortably,
          yet they are unacknowledged.
          But I believe that society can improve. Ableism is one of many problems that only society can improve, if we're all on the same page.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm not asking for much.
          But we should take to heart that having connections is part of the way for
          survival and evolution as a human species.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even if someone looks "crippled" or "slow in the head",
          we're all human. We acknowledge it, yet we fail to address it
          when the people in front of us are capable of emotions and extraordinary feats.

        <h1>The Aftermath of SOWK350</h1>
        <p>
          As a result of taking this class, the beliefs and assumptions I had going into this class were refined
          when I opened the book and spent countless nights and Sundays reading chapters about human diversity.
          I am aware of some topics that were already apparent with my generation, but there were few topics that
          I admit I never heard of, like Ageism.
        </p>
        <p>
          This past semester I was able to talk and meet with an amazing group, like Alana, Chloe, Leah, and Broderick.
          The hours we spent talking about current-day subjects was like a breath of fresh air to me. I never got to talk
          about these issues that are going on in our society, and the meetings all felt natural because we were having adult
          conversations in the real world. The knowledge we shared with each other about our society felt grounded and nautral,
          and everyone was surprisingly competent with each other.
        </p>

        <p>
          Back in March, I went through an internal crisis that made me want to quit Computer Science completely. I was failing,
          and the six years of knowledge I gained from my sophomore year of high school to my junior year of college
          would have all been for nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had a meeting with my advisor who told me that even though I don't want to do Computer Science
          anymore, I would much rather have it as a hobby. This creative project gave me an opportunity to attempt to put the skills I gained
          from Thaddeus Stevens to use. The skills I learned in the six years of programming will never fade away,
          and neither will the stories of the oppressed from our readings will remain with me too and hold dear as I have a better grasp on humanity's errors.
